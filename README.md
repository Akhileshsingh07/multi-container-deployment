# multi-container-deploymet
please refer my Documentation file  given in mail for detailed deployment approach .

This repository contains the code for a multi-container application deployment using Docker Compose and Kubernetes, Minikube. The application consists of multiple containers including frontend, backend, and database components.

Technologies Used
Docker: Docker is a containerization technology used to package the application components.
Docker Compose: Tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.
Minikube: Local Kubernetes cluster tool for testing and development.
Kubernetes: Container orchestration platform used for deploying and managing containerized applications.

Deployment Strategy
Development/ Building Environment (Docker Compose)
For local development, Docker Compose is used to define the application and its dependencies by this Devops engineer can quickly start all parts of the app together using just one command. This makes it faster to build and test the app."

Production Environment (Kubernetes)
In the production-like environment, the application is deployed to a Kubernetes cluster. This provides some advanced features like auto scaling , auto healing , clusture architechture and easier management of the application in a real-world scenario.  here Minikube is utilized for setting up and running a local Kubernetes cluster for testing the deployment before production.

conclusion:-The project gets me deep practical demonstration of Deploying the 3 tier Application which is containerized in using Docker compose and deployed on kubernetes cluster using Minikube.
This project gained me learning in best practices for containerization kubernetes deployment.
